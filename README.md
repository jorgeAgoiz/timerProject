### Timer App in progress

 This is a basic exercise to practice OOP in JavaScript.
 
 How the timer works:
  * You must write the time that you want inside the input, in the center.
  * You have two buttons, play and pause the timer.
  * The svg animation reduce the perimeter at the same time as timer is running out.
